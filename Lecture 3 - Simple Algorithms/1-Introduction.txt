Eric Grimson: In this third lecture we are going to start building on our
ability to write simple programs.
In particular, we're going to introduce the concept of iteration, or
how to repeat a method multiple times in order to reuse the computation to
execute something an arbitrary number of times.
Once we have iteration, we can start doing some interesting classes of
algorithms.
Starting with guess and check methods, the guess and answer, check it, and
then use the results to improve the guess.
This will lead naturally to the idea of loop constructs, or mechanisms in
our language that let us generalize the idea of repeating a computation
until a particular condition is reached.
This will let us generalize our guess and check methods to a broader group
of algorithms called successive approximation, and especially to a
very common and very powerful method called bisection search.
At the end of this lecture you will be able to write simple algorithms that
solve numerical problems by improving approximate estimates of the answer to
get successively better guesses.
