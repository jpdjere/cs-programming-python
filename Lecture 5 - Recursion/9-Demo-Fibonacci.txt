Let's visualize what happens with a Fibonacci series, using the original
idea from Leonardo.
We start off with the single female.
At the end of one month, she's pregnant.
Which means at the end of the next month, she's still there, but she's
given birth or whelped another female.
At the end of the next month, that first female again has
whelped one more time.
The first offspring is now pregnant.
And there are now three rabbits running around.
And at each stage you can see that after one month of growth, if you
like, each new rabbit produces another one.
So at this next stage two of them whelp, at the next stage three of them
whelp, at the next stage five of them whelp.
And you can see we're going to have a ton of rabbits in a hurry.
