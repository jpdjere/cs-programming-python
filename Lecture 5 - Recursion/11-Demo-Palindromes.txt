Let's visualize what this idea of checking if something is
a palindrome does.
The basic idea is to check the first and last letter to see
if they're the same.
And then if they are, to check the remaining middle portion to see if
it's a palindrome.
So here's ablewasiereisawelba, all reduced down just
to lowercase letters.
And so at the first step, we check to see are the two end cases the same?
They are, and that reduces to checking a smaller thing.
Again, we check to see if the first and last character are the same, they
are, and that reduces to checking a smaller thing.
And at each stage, we keep checking the end characters.
In this case they are all the same, and we keep reducing to smaller and
smaller versions of the same problem.
