Eric Grimson: Welcome to 600x.

1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,780
In this first lecture, we&#39;re going to talk about some of the fundamental

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,590
principles of computation and computational thinking.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,790
For example, what does a computer actually do?

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,239
What are its fundamental operations?

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,880
How do those fundamental operations support what we call imperative

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,280
knowledge or how-to methods?

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,270
What are the basic elements of a computer that enable it to compute

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:31,070
things, described by algorithms, or how-to recipes?

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,940
And finally, how can we use a language, a programming language in

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,100
our case, to describe those recipes?
