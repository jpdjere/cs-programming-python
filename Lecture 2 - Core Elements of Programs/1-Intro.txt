Eric Grimson: Welcome back to 600x.
In this second lecture we are going to start developing knowledge of
programming languages.
We'll talk about how a computer converts a description of a how-to
method that we write in a high level, although a semantically constrained
manner, into a set of instructions that its internal
circuitry can execute.
To do this, we're going to begin to introduce the basic elements of
Python, the language we're going to use in this course.
We will introduce a bunch of things.
Numbers, expressions that combine numbers arithmetically, ways to
compare objects like numbers, Boolean operations on logical expressions,
ways to abstract expressions by giving them names,
strings or collections of characters and words and operations on them,
combining expressions in a linear manner, and simple ways to make
decisions and to take different options or branches
based on those decisions.
At the end of this lecture, you should be able to write simple programs that
manipulate numbers or strings, make decisions, and print out results.
